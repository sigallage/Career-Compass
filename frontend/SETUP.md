# Frontend Setup Instructions

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Zero Configuration Required!)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it! The application will work immediately on any PC without any configuration.

## âœ¨ Features
- âœ… **Zero configuration** - works out of the box
- âœ… **Universal compatibility** - runs on any PC, any port
- âœ… **Auto-detects URLs** - no manual callback URL setup needed
- âœ… **No environment files** - no `.env` setup required

## How It Works
The Auth0 configuration is now built-in and uses dynamic URL detection, so:
- Any port (5173, 5174, 3000, etc.) works automatically
- Any localhost or 127.0.0.1 address works
- No environment variable setup required
- No Auth0 dashboard changes needed

## Development
```bash
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm run build  # Build for production
npm run preview # Preview production build
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, simply:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the server

The signup functionality will work immediately without any additional setup!
